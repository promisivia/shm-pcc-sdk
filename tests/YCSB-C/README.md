# CXL-SDK YCSB-C driver

This directory contains the YCSB-C workload driver and adapters used to test
CXL-SDK's concurrent indexes. The driver is based on the C++ port of the
[Yahoo! Cloud Serving Benchmark](https://github.com/basicthinker/YCSB-C) and has
been extended with shared-memory setup, paper experiment variants, and adapters
for BwTree, ClevelHash, CLHT, HOT, Masstree, RadixART, BTreeOLC, and Sherman.

## Dependencies

On Ubuntu or Debian:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y \
  build-essential cmake libboost-all-dev libcityhash-dev \
  libibverbs-dev libjemalloc-dev libmemkind-dev libnuma-dev \
  libssh-dev libtbb-dev
```

## Build

Build one or more variants. The final variant becomes the `./ycsbc` symlink.

```bash
./build.sh cc nocc
```

The `cc` variant uses ordinary cache-coherent atomics. The `nocc` variant
enables the paper's cache-bypassing implementation plus the G2/G3 optimization
flags. Additional variants are declared in [`CMakeLists.txt`](CMakeLists.txt).

For an isolated compile-only check that does not create local build directories,
run the repository harness:

```bash
../../tools/opensource-harness/run.sh --full
```

## Local smoke run

The tracked `config.ini` describes the paper hardware setup and expects a DAX
device. For a single-process file-backed smoke test, create the backing file and
select `config.local.ini` explicitly:

```bash
truncate -s 1G /tmp/cxl-sdk-shm
./run_shm_ds.sh -db=bwtree -mode=smoke -config=config.local.ini
```

The local configuration requests a fixed virtual address. If that address is
already occupied, adjust `mmap_base_addr`; all cooperating processes must use
the same address.

## Paper workloads

The 100-million-record YCSB A/B/C configurations used by the paper are:

- `workloads/workloada_zipfian_100m.spec` — 50% read, 50% update;
- `workloads/workloadb_zipfian_100m.spec` — 95% read, 5% update; and
- `workloads/workloadc_zipfian_100m.spec` — 100% read.

The generator's Zipf exponent defaults to 0.99. Paper-scale runs are
hardware-specific and may modify ASLR only when explicitly requested:

```bash
DISABLE_ASLR=1 ./run_shm_ds.sh \
  -db=bwtree -mode=server_thread_scale_test -config=config.ini
```

`DISABLE_ASLR=1` uses `sudo` and restores the previous kernel setting after the
command. It is unnecessary for ordinary builds and should be enabled only on a
dedicated experiment host.

## External Twitter traces

The Twitter cache traces are not distributed in this repository. Point the
driver at a dataset layout containing `<TRACE_PATH>/<TRACE_NAME>/clusterNNN`:

```bash
TRACE_PATH=/data/cache-trace/samples \
TRACE_NAME=2020Mar \
./run_shm_ds.sh -db=bwtree -mode=run_real_workloads
```

The launcher validates the dataset directory before starting. No developer
machine path is embedded in the script.

## Direct invocation

You can bypass the launcher and invoke the selected binary directly:

```bash
./ycsbc \
  -db bwtree \
  -client_threads 1 \
  -server_threads 2 \
  -dbnum 1 \
  -P workloads/workloada_small.spec \
  -C config.local.ini
```

Run `./ycsbc` without arguments to see all supported options.
